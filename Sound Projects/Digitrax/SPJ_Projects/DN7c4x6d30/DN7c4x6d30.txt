	INTRODUCTION
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is the Sound Definition Language (SDL) file for a project that can be
  used for a 16bit premium 2mb sound decoder for a typical steam locomotive. 
Features:
	Bells -- bells may be chained to play for simulation of rope pulls
	Low Idle -- Optional, Idle run is trimmed, also optional ALCO stumble
	Fans -- High and low alternate random
	Estop -- SF15 will trigger shutdown
	Auto Vary Notch	--	motor sounds vary: idle blip, load sensing
	Variable Dynamics -- SF4 will notch up to run 4 and play dynamic fan, speed varied by throttle setting
	Horns/Whistles -- Selectable, playable, signal toots
		Grade crossing horn plays rear horn sounds going backwards
		Analog Playable Horn/whistle/horn (horn runs that had the transition to higher pressure/ very loud modes)
	Brake Interlock	-- SF10 will lock motor at standstill until released
		Integrated automatic braking sounds on SF3
		All brakes are controlled by SF10 (formerly SF3) so that servo motor decoder braking could be syncronized
		EStop  on SF8 On with SF10 on shut-down	(disables motor movement until SF8 OFF)
	Manual Notch Run mode 
	with SF26+ and SF27- as well as automatic...)
	Tracton Motors

Changes v7.0:

COLD STARTUP FUNCTIONS:
	Play Startup Sounds: 
		COLD START SF4 or SF8 (initial time only, otherwise will mute)
		Force COLD START F19.
	The following Function Keys will SKIP STARTUP Sounds and begin with RUN sounds:
	SF8, SF0, SF1, SF2, SF5, SF11	
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	DESIGN NOTES 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Make sure that the model CV133 Steam Chuff/CAM config, 128=>EXT cam, 1-127=>DRIVER dia in inches[63]
	and CV134 Gear ratio are adjusted so that THERE ARE 4 STANDARD NON-ARTICULATED
		CHUFFS PER REVOLUTION.

SET -- SCALE_MIN,2,0	Range Volume Scale 1-14 to a value between 2-15
						Drifting volume will diminish to this level.

Limits:
	One SPJ project SDF of multiple schemes can run up to 64Kbytes of code.
	A single scheme has a 4Kbyte GOTO instruction branch range. (e.g. 2K 2-byte or 1K 4-byte instructions)
	That means that a BRANCH_TO an address beyond the range limit will not execute...

Changes and Bug Fixes:



Function Key Mapping:
This version (v7) includes new sections for mapping functions to default to other manufactures F0-F28 keys. 
Or you can edit the TRIG include file, re-assemble and make your own custom function mapping.

HOW FUNCTION KEY MAPPING WORKS
Mapping functions to default to other manufactures F0-F28 keys:
Mapping is done by using symbolic constants to define the hex value for each function key. 
For example TRIG_WHISTLES_ON is a value of 0x09. 
The hex value 0x09 is the physical decoder function key (F2 in this case). 
This is the same as the standard include for TRIG_SF2	 EQU  0x09    ;byte 1, bit1.  
And the new symbolic constant is TRIG_HORN_ON	 EQU  0x09    ;2-F2: byte 1, bit1. 
The new base code uses the remapped symbolic name for all functions. 
So any change to the physical assignment is masked.
Whereas TRIG_SF4	 EQU 0x0B now has a symbolic value of TRIG_OPENCYLS_ON EQU 0x0B ;4-F4: CYL COCKS
One of the re-mapped values is TRIG_SAFETY_ON	 EQU  0x24 ;25-F25: BLOWOFF
This means that when F25 is toggled the SAFETY BLOWOFF sound function will play.
I have annotated eac EQU statement with the physical decoder button number 
for example: 2-F2: byte 1, bit1
See SR7TrigV7.INC for F-Key values. The ASM code has the INCLUDE for this file name.

NOTES:
 notch volume routine is improved when the volume scale is set by
	other external events (deceleration, start from standing, acceleration, etc.)
	VARY_LOAD is used to implement the effect

----------------------------------
     FUNCTION KEYS DEFINED:   
----------------------------------
(A) Function Key Usage: 
F0- Lights  [disables start-up sounds when on during initialization]
F1- Bell (Bells1-4 may be chained)
F2- Horn/Whistle	CV150 selects Horn/Whistle type	(Playable when bit7 of CV150 is on)	-- Shorter sounds when SF3 ON
F3- Coupler / Coupler disconnect	[Auto-coupler/brake set by  CV151 max spd]
		Lift ring and connect plays with SF3 when SF3 is ON
		Long train consist brake sounds with SF19 ON
		Steam Wheel Slip on start-up (Enable) /auto coupler
		(disables toots on SF3) [Leave on for auto toots]
F4- Dynamic brake fans when moving		
		Otherwise: Handbrake sequence	[Handbrake while stopped] 
		Handbrake loop will PLAY until SF14 Off
		Must be toggled off after start-up (SF10+SF11) or else handbrake will 
		keep unit from moving...
F5- Emergency Lights / Reserved for light function (turn on rear light, etc.) / Cold start when on
F6- Ditchlights (Front -- flashing)
F7- Wheel Flange (continuous when moving) [Disables bell on SF1]
F8- Prime Mover ON / Mute control/Start-up	[SF8 to OFF is muted to CV volume, 
		SF8 ON, set REG volume]
		On the initial push of SF8 the sound comes up. 
		A secondary push raises the sound again to normal levels.
		EStop  on SF8 On with SF10 on shut-down	(disables motor movement until OFF)
F9- UNCOUPLE
F10- BRAKE TO STOP -- Usage:
			Independent Brake/Train Brake	[Leave SF3 OFF for auto brakes] 
			[SF10 on will enable servo motor stop.]
			Toggle OFF plays directional toots WHEN SF3 ON
		1) Slow servo motor to stop using CV3,CV4 momentum values (where
			larger value (50) takes longer to slow/accelerate)
		2) Lock motor at standstill to simulate engine brake set. Servo
			will not resume until SF10 is toggled off.
		3) While brake is set toggle SF3 on to begin uncoupling. SF3 will play 
			lift ring noise in preparation for disconnect. 
		4) Releasing the brake and advancing the throttle will play coupler
			disconnect when SF3 is already on.
		Brake rate is determined by BEMF and CV3,4
	 	Auto Coupler coupler clank and BRAKE if SF3 is ON,  is dir chng and last PK spd below e.g. CV151
			[Auto-coupler/brake set by  CV151 max spd] SF3 ON for un-coupler
			[Leave SF3 on for auto coupler]	
			EStop  on SF8 On with SF10 on Shutdown	(disables servo motor movement until OFF)
			Toggle OFF plays directional toots WHEN F11 OFF
 	SF10 OFF -- Release Brake [not SF10 Apply else Release] 
		Use for start-up -- SF10 on + F11 on to cold start (release F11 to end fuel prime)
F11- High Fan 
		Allow SUSTAIN horn on SF2
F12- Coupler / Coupler disconnect	[Autocoupler/brake set by  CV151 max spd]
		Lift ring and connect plays with SF3 when F11 is ON
		Long train consist brake sounds with SF19 ON
		Steam Wheel Slip on start-up (Enable) /auto coupler
		(disables toots on SF3) [Leave on for auto toots]
F13- Ditchlights (Rear -- flashing)
F14- Hand Brake
F15- EStop when moving and shut-down	(disables motor movement until OFF)
F16- Air Dryer 
F17- Brake Set / Release Automatic
F18- Sanding Valve 
F19- Short Air Let Off	/ Cold ReStart
F20- Compressor / Air features disable  
		SF20 ON =disable AIR sound/FEATURES, trig BLOWOFF/HNDL_FAST_DRYER1 then compressor ONE time
		[SF20 OFF enables pop-off, DRYER and compressor]
F21- Straight to manual notch1
F22- Engine Compartment Sounds
F23- Grade crossing Air-horn sequence	[Bell stays on until SF23 off]
F24- Reverser Center
F25- Enables AUX generator / HEP 
F26- Manual Notching Up 
		Leave on for increased load
		Leave SF26 OFF to use run trim option: [will increment 
		notches on acceleration events 
		SF27 will decrement run trim.
F27- Notch down	-- Leave ON for decreased load
		Toggle SF27 ON Is notch down for EVENT, 
			integrate -VE in SPEED_DELTA
		SF27 will decrement run trim (i.e., use to select lower trim value).
		Wheel-slip, when CV155 is not 0 and SF3 ON
		Manual Notching Down / Coast
F28- Straight to manual notch8
============================ virtual functions: =====================
F29- FORCE STARTUP SOUNDS / Load / Global Gain
F30- Pressing SF30 on the throttle once HEP has already been 
		engaged will allow the prime mover to come down a little. 
F34- Cab Chatter / Shutters	--	 Cab Sounds

	==================================  
Note: Many sound levels have been reduced so that horn/whistle is much louder.
	Global Gain in the project has been maximized to help. Some low volume 
	levels may need increases on your model.

(C) General Notes
Project sounds are amplified to the limit. When lower power is supplied while on
a test bench using SoundLoader louder sounds will exceed the speaker output range (see formula). 
Running at full power on the main track in real use, sound levels may be increase significantly.
This project was tested at Master Volume CV58=11. Horn Volume was tested at CV142>50. 
Prime mover Volume was tested at CV140>50. However,
Default Master Volume CV58=9 THIS SHOULD BE 7 OR LESS FOR TESTING WITH SOUNDLOADER - JohnM 3/23/17

Set CV60 to 0 for this project.
The SDXH166 16bit series2 SFX decoders allow downloading of 8,12 and 16 bit wave files and up to 4 
voices defined in the SDF project definition embedded in SPJ file. 

For CV155=01 ["Semi_automatic Notching"] when CV60=0 to 5 (Diesel),  the Prime mover lowest Notch setting is set by
the current throttle speed setting. SF26 (ON) can increase the Notch and SF27 (ON) will decrease the Prime mover
to the minimum notch set by current throttle setting.

Cam triggered exhaust sounds (e.g. steam) are only configured for 8 or 16 bit wav file downloads.
